Changes:
tunix.c, sched.c, proc.h, makefile u=sequences

tunix:
New functions: #tick_handler, #tick_init, #tick_deinit, set_timer_count
Modified: k_init, process0, init_proctab, shutdown, syscallc, sysexit

* #k_init calls tick_init with count 11932 and shutdown calls tick_deinit
* Timer count is set to 11932 that is approx 10ms.
* timer interrupt calls tick_handler which calls scheduler if curpoc QUANTUM is reduced to 0
* QUANTUM is set to 4.

* process0:
* removed scheduler() call from while loop, now only stays in while loop till all procs are zombied.
* calls shutdown subsequently.

* init_proctab:
* intializing proctab for quantum set to 4, cpu and num outchar set to 0.

shutdown:
* printing cpu and outchars for each process.
* printing call site number for scheduler i.e. tick_handler, sysexit and sleep.

syscallc:
* for write call increment outchar number of curpoc by value returned in user_eax.

sysexit:
* added protection around number of zombies.


sched.c:
* Added interger parameter to scheduler(int call_site_id)
* increment the scheduler_call_site_index[call_site_id].
* Call Site 0 is tick_handler, sysexit is Site 1, and Site 2 is sleep.

proc.h:
* declared extern scheduler_call_site_index[] that is defined in tunix.c
*   and access/incremented per call site from scheduler.
